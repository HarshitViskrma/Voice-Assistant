# Voice-Assistant
Voice assistant software is designed to process voice commands and respond with relevant actions or information. It utilizes speech recognition technology to convert spoken language into text, which is then processed using natural language understanding (NLU) algorithms. The software interprets user intent, retrieves necessary data, and generates responses using text-to-speech (TTS) or visual output. Core functionalities include answering questions, setting reminders, controlling smart home devices, sending messages, making calls, and executing app-specific commands. Many voice assistants integrate with AI and machine learning models to improve accuracy and personalize interactions over time. Additionally, they support multi-turn conversations, context awareness, and voice biometrics for authentication, enhancing both usability and security.
